            <b>9th July 2022</b> </br>
            We initially started streaming to YouTube as a way of storing our recordings (and for covid and stuff too of course).
            Last week one of our YouTube streams got reported and taken down, so this may no longer be a reliable way to store recordings.
            Therefore we will start saving a copy of the recordings locally.<br><br>

            All we need to do is to click "Start Recording" at the bottom left of the OBS window when we start the stream.
            The recordings will go to the "Videos" folder. No need to do anything with them yet.<br>
