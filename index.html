            We may now be setting up a speaker outside on the patio area. Winnie or someone from the Sunday services chat will inform us if we do need it.</br>
            This is just to let some regulars sit outside if there really is no space in the hall.</br>
            An XLR out can be taken from AUX6, which can be threaded through the kitchen and out a window to a speaker.
            There is a power point right under the window for the speaker.
            Make sure the XLR is taped down if it is being used.

            <b>9th July 2022</b> Updated 11th July:</br>
            <br>
            On the 3rd of July one of our YouTube streams got taken down.
            In order to ensure that it can be made available,
            we will start saving a copy of the recordings locally.
            For now we are also suspecting that it might be the music we play from spotify.
            Let's not play that after the formal part of the service.<br><br>

            In order to record, all we need to do is to click "Start Recording" at the bottom left of the OBS window when we start the stream.
            The recordings will go to the "Videos" folder. No need to do anything with them yet.<br>
